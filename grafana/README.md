# Grafana

This is a Dockerfile for a Grafana application based on the official Grafana image. The following instructions are included:

1. Use the version directive to specify the version of the Docker Compose file format that this file uses. In this case, we use version 3.
2. Define a service for a Grafana container. The image field specifies the Docker image to use for this service, which is set to grafana/grafana:latest.
3. The restart field is set to unless-stopped. This means that if the container is stopped, it will not be restarted unless it is manually started or the Docker daemon is restarted.
4. The ports section maps port 3000 of the host to port 3000 of the container.
5. The volumes section mounts a directory called grafana on the host to the /var/lib/grafana directory in the container.

# Usage

1. Save the Dockerfile to a file named docker-compose.yml.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the Dockerfile.
3. Run the command docker-compose up to start the Grafana container.
4. Once the container is running, you can access it by connecting to port 3000 of the host machine using a web browser or a REST client like curl.
5. To stop the Grafana container, run the command docker-compose down.

Note that this Dockerfile assumes that you have already installed Docker on your system. If you haven't, you can download it from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
