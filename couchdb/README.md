# CouchDB

This is a Dockerfile for a CouchDB container based on the ibmcom/couchdb3 image. The following instructions are included:

- Use the version directive to specify the version of the Docker Compose file format that this file uses. In this case, we use version 3.
- Define a service for a CouchDB container. The image field specifies the Docker image to use for this service, which is set to ibmcom/couchdb3. The platform field specifies the platform architecture for the service, which is set to linux/amd64 in this case. This tells Docker to use the Linux x86-64 (AMD64) architecture when running the service.
- The environment section sets the username and password for the database, and the ports section maps port 5984 of the host to port 5984 of the container. Finally, the volumes section mounts a directory called couchdata on the host to the /opt/couchdb/data directory in the container.
- The restart field is set to unless-stopped. This means that if the container is stopped, it will not be restarted unless it is manually started or the Docker daemon is restarted.

# Usage

To use this Dockerfile, follow these steps:

1.  Save the Dockerfile to a file named docker-compose.yml.
2.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the Dockerfile.
3.  Run the command docker-compose up to start the CouchDB container.
4.  Once the container is running, you can access it by connecting to port 5984 on the host machine using a web browser or a REST client like curl. The username and password for the database are specified in the environment section of the Dockerfile.
5.  To stop the CouchDB container, run the command docker-compose down.

Note that this Dockerfile assumes that you have already installed Docker on your system. If you haven't, you can download it from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
